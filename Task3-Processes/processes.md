## What will be the git branching strategy? (elaborate options with pros and cons)

I choose GitHub Flow for simplicity and because it works well for small teams aiming for continuos deployments.

GitHub Flow

A simplified workflow with a single main branch and short-lived feature branches.
Developers create a feature branch from main.
When the feature is complete, a pull request is opened.
Code is reviewed and tested before merging back into main.

Pros:
    - Simple and easy to understand.
    - Works well with continuous deployment.

Cons:
    - Less structured than some other workflows.
    - May not provide enough isolation for complex release cycles.

GitLab Flow

Combines elements from GitHub Flow and Git Flow, with an emphasis on environment branches.
main branch for production-ready code.
feature branches for new features.
release branches for preparing releases.
environment branches (e.g., staging, production) for different deployment environments.

Pros:
    Balances simplicity and structure.
    Supports multiple environments.
    Provides clear separation between development and production.
Cons:
    More complex than GitHub Flow.
    Requires proper documentation and management.

## Which tool you will consider for CI/CD?

It depends what tools the team is already using or planning to use.

- If the team is working with Microsoft ecosystem using Azure Cloud and Azure Devops for Git Repositories, then Azure Devops is the best option for CI/CD pipelines as well, as it integrates seamlessly.

- If the project code is in Github, then naturally Github Actions would be my choice. It has an extensive marketplace for actions and is highly customizable.

- If the project code is in GitLab, I would go with the native integration GitLab CI/CD.

- Regarding the tool for code management, for CD I would implement GitOps approach via ArgoCD.

## What will be your build promotion plans (Dev - QA - Prod)? & Provide CI/CD implementation plans with stages

1. Development (Dev)

Process:

- Developers create feature branches from the main branch to work on new features or bug fixes.
- Developers commit and push changes to their feature branches.
- Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline runs automatically on each commit to the feature branch.

CI Pipeline for Dev:

- Linting: Ensure code quality and consistency.
- Unit Tests: Validate individual components or functions.
- Build: Compile the code and create build artifacts.
- Integration Tests: Validate the interaction between components.

Outcome:
The feature branch is validated through the CI pipeline, ensuring that the code meets quality standards and passes all tests.

2. Quality Assurance (QA)

Process:

- Once a feature is complete, the developer opens a pull request (PR) from the feature branch to the main branch.
- The code is reviewed by peers, and any feedback is addressed.
- After approval, the PR is merged into the main branch.
- Once merged, the build is automatically deployed to a staging environment for QA testing.

CI/CD Pipeline for QA:

- Integration Tests: Run integration tests to ensure the new code works well with the existing codebase.
- Deploy to Staging: Deploy the build artifacts to the staging environment.
- Acceptance Tests: Execute acceptance tests in the staging environment to validate end-to-end functionality.

Outcome:
The code is tested in a staging environment that mimics production, allowing QA to identify and report any issues.
The application is validated through acceptance tests, ensuring it meets the requirements.

3. Production (Prod)

Process:

- After QA approves the changes in the staging environment, the code is ready to be deployed to production.
- A manual approval step is included to ensure the deployment is intentional and verified.
- Once approved, the build is deployed to the production environment.

CD Pipeline for Prod:

- Manual Approval: Require approval from a manager or QA lead before deployment.
- Deploy to Production: Deploy the build artifacts to the production environment.
- Smoke Tests: Perform basic checks to ensure the application is running correctly in production.
- Monitoring and Rollback: Monitor the application for any issues and have a rollback plan in place if necessary.

## How will you manage module version dependencies?

- Dependency Management Tools

I would use package managers like npm (for Node.js), Maven (for Java), or Pip (for Python) to manage dependencies between modules. Each module can be published as a package and versioned appropriately (e.g. SemVer).

It is also helpful to integrate dependency checks into the CI pipeline to ensure that the corret versions of modules are used and updated as needed.
